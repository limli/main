== Introduction

REstaurant Manager (REM) is for small/medium size restaurant owners who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their restaurant*. More importantly, REM is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, REM can get your restaurant management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

As REM is targeted at _restaurant owners_, it aims to facilitate the management of a restaurant, in these 5 different areas:

* Member Management
    ** Manage the contact details of the customers with membership
* Inventory Management
    ** Manage the inventory of recipes and stocks of inventory
* Booking Management
    ** Manage the reservations made by the general public
* Staff management
    ** Manage the contact details of the staff, and facilitate their shift work allocation
* Statistics
    ** Collates bookings data into graphs
* Overall
    ** Collation of feedback by customers, and general statistics of the performance of the restaurant

This user guide is designed to provide assistance to Restaurant Managers who utilise REM.

Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `rem.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Restaurant Manager.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
** After launching the application, below are some sample commands you can try:

* *`listMembers`* : lists all members of the restaurant
* **`addMember`**`addMember n/John Doe e/johnd@gmail.com p/81234567` : adds a member named `John Doe` to the restaurant.
* **`deleteMember`**`3` : deletes the 3rd member shown in the current list of members
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  You can refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features
====
*Command Format*

* Commands begin with the intended task, followed by a number of parameters preceded by a key (comprised of a one or more letters and forward slash, for example, `n/`). The intended task is non case-sensitive in the program and can be typed quickly as (for example, `addMember` can be typed as `addmember`), but is written in this manner in the user guide for greater readability.
* Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user. For example, `CUSTOMER_NAME`, `EMAIL` and `PHONE_NUMBER` in the command below are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
    ** `addMember n/CUSTOMER_NAME e/EMAIL p/PHONE_NUMBER`.
* Parameters in square brackets are optional parameters and can be omitted. For example, `LOYALTY_POINTS` below is an optional parameter.
    ** `addMember n/CUSTOMER_NAME e/EMAIL p/PHONE_NUMBER [l/LOYALTY_POINTS]`
* Parameters with `...` after them can be used multiple times (including zero times) in the command. For example, `INGREDIENT_INDEX&INGREDIENT_QUANTITY_IN_RECIPE` can be specified multiple times in the command below.
    ** `addRecipe r/RECIPE_NAME iq/INGREDIENT_INDEX&INGREDIENT_QUANTITY_IN_RECIPE ...`
* Parameters can be supplied in any order. For example, the following way of writing the `addMember` command above is also valid.
    ** `addMember p/PHONE_NUMBER n/CUSTOMER_NAME e/EMAIL`

=== Booking Management

The booking section models booking made by members.

* A booking consists of a member, a start time and an integer representing the number of persons coming to the restaurant.
* In this section, `TIME` parameters follow the yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm (e.g. `2019-02-23T13:00` means 23 Feb 2019, 1300 hrs) or HH:mm (e.g. `12:00`) format. If the HH:mm format is used, the date is automatically chosen to be the current date at the point of command execution.
* For the exact specification of what date and time formats are allowed, please refer to the `LocalDateTime` and `LocalTime` class in Java.
* In order to ensure that the restaurant does not get overbooked, REM allows you to adjust the restaurant capacity. This capacity indicates the maximum number of customers that can be present in the restaurant at any given time. REM assumes that customers stay in the restaurant for 1 hour before leaving, although the end time is not displayed on screen.
* REM does not allow non-members to make bookings and every booking must correspond to a single member. If this member is deleted, all bookings made by the member will also be deleted.

==== List Booking: `listBookings` [Coming in v2.0]

View the current lists of bookings within a certain time frame

Format: `listBookings [ts/TIME_START] [te/TIME_END]` +
Shortcut: `em INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [l/LOYALTY_POINTS]`

****
• The start and end times are optional arguments. If not specified, the list of all bookings (i.e. including future and past bookings) made so far will be displayed.
****

Example:

* `listBookings ts/2019-03-01 12:00 te/2019-03-04 15:00`

==== Update Restaurant Capacity: `updateCapacity`

Want to ensure that your restaurant does not get overbooked? Make sure to update the capacity of the restaurant accordingly.

Format: `updateCapacity NUMBER` +
Shortcut: `uc NUMBER`

****
• The default capacity of the restaurant is 200.
• If the capacity is full, the restaurant will not accept new bookings (refer to <<Create New Booking: `addBooking`, addBooking command >>).
****

Example:

* `updateCapacity 50`

This updates the restaurants to cater for a capacity of 50 customers. If any operation results in having more than 50 customers at any point in time, REM will show an error message indicating that the restaurant is full (unless the `updateCapacity` command is used again).

==== Add New Booking: `addBooking`

Creates a new booking.

Format: `addBooking c/CUSTOMER_INDEX n/NUMBER OF PERSONS ts/TIME_START` +
Shortcut: `ab c/CUSTOMER_INDEX n/NUMBER OF PERSONS ts/TIME_START`

****
• All bookings will last for 1 hour, although the end time is not shown in the UI.

• Customer INDEX refers to the index of the customer as displayed by the list.

• Bookings are a privileged feature restricted only to members. REM does not allow non-members to make bookings.

• If the booking is rejected due to capacity constraints, a message will appear suggesting an alternative timeslot. This timeslot is the earliest timeslot after the input date and time that can be accepted. Note that this does not automatically add the booking into REM- a separate `addBooking` command needs to be entered to accept the newly suggested timeslot.
****

Example (execute these commands in the order listed with no other commands inserted in between, starting with a list of at least 2 members and an initially empty list of bookings):

* `updateCapacity 10` (updates the restaurant capacity to 10)

* `addBooking c/1 n/7 ts/2019-04-07T12:00` (adds a booking for the first customer on the current list, on 7 Apr, at 1200 hrs)

* `addbooking c/2 n/7 ts/2019-04-07T11:30` (adds a booking for the second customer on the current list, on 7 Apr, at 1200 hrs)

This command will fail to execute. As bookings last for 1 hour, accepting this command will cause the restaurant to exceed the capacity of 10 customers at 2019-04-07T12:00 (in fact, 7+7=14 customers will be present if this command executes). Thus this booking is rejected.

.A pictorial representation showing why the capacity will be exceeded
image::capacityexplanation.png[width="600"]
The user may also notice that an alternative booking time of 2019-04-07T13:00 is suggested by REM. The suggested booking time is the next available slot after the input time (in this case, 2019-04-07T11:30) that can hold the booking of 7 members. In this case, the restaurant is only free at 2019-04-07T13:00 after the previous group of 7 customers leave (recall that bookings last for 1 hour).

The below screenshot shows what happens:

image::altbookingtime.png[width="800"]

==== Edit Booking: `editBooking`
Edits a booking by changing either the time, number of persons of both.

Format: `editBooking INDEX [ts/TIME_START] [n/NUMBER_OF_PERSONS]` +
Shortcut: `eb INDEX [ts/TIME_START] [n/NUMBER_OF_PERSONS]`

****
• Edits the booking at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing. REM will not execute this operation if this causes capacity to be exceeded.
****

Example:

* `editBooking 3 ts/12:00 n/6`

Edits the booking at index 3, changing the booking time to 12:00 for 6 persons. Since the date was unspecified, the current date (at the point of entering the command) will be used.

* `editBooking 4 ts/2019-03-30T17:00`

Edits the booking at index 4, changing the booking time to 30 March 2019, 12:00. The number of persons remains unchanged as it was previously unspecified.
